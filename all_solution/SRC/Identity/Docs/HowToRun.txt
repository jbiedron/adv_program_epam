Start Identity.API and Catalog.API
Use postman (see screenshots).

Identity Server is using InMemory configuration and adding users and roles is done thru code not api invokes.
To fix we can integrate Identity.UI (quickstart sample) to make it work together with inmem configuration.

Still need to fix accees to API - for now manager has access to all prodcuct requests and buyer has access to all categories requests - cosmetics
